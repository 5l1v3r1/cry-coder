[+] when you try to decode the file , make sure that you have the 
correct password , because if you enter the incorrect password for decode
the file , the file will not be able to decode again :) , its mean you cant
recover your file again :(

[!] but i have good solution , when you enter the password for decode
whatever its correct or incorrect , the tool will copy the file to : 
"origine-file" ( in cry-coder-master )
so when you need to recover your file , but you enter the incorrect password 
(key), Go to : "original-file" ( in cry-coder-master ) and try to decode 
The file that you found there, because it is the file that can be decode again

[+] That's it, the tool is under development.
